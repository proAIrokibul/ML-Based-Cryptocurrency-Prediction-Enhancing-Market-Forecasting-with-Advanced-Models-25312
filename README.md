## 🤖 Modeling & Performance Comparison  
Three machine learning models were implemented to predict market movements:  

1️⃣ **Logistic Regression**  
2️⃣ **Random Forest Classifier**  
3️⃣ **XGBoost Classifier**  

### 🎯 **Model Accuracy Results:**  
| Model                  | Accuracy |
|------------------------|----------|
| 📊 Logistic Regression | **56.03%** |
| 🌲 Random Forest       | **46.30%** |
| ⚡ XGBoost             | **45.14%** |

The results indicate that **Logistic Regression** performed the best among the tested models, achieving an accuracy of **56.03%**. However, further improvements can be made through **hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, or deep learning approaches**.
